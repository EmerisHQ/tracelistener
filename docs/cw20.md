# CW20 tokens support

# wasm module

Before talking specifically about CW20 token, let’s see how CosmWasm store _contracts state._

Since `wasm` is a Cosmos SDK module, it just uses the `application.db` LevelDB just like other modules (e.g. `bank`).

`wasm` uses the db for storing different kind of data:

- contracts **code** (i.e. wasm binaries)
- contract instances (contracts code can instantiated multiple time with different initial values, e.g. the CW20 code can exist once and then being used by multiple tokens, each instance have a different address)
- contract instance **state** (the actual state we are interested in). The contract wasm code being executed has [some primitives](https://docs.rs/cosmwasm-std/0.16.5/cosmwasm_std/) that allow developers to read/write from the contract state, think of this as an abstraction layer over `application.db`.

Each of this kind of data has a specific prefix in `application.db` key:

[https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd/blob/e03c7f4f885d97fc310b068ebca4d5cfb107a782/x/wasm/types/keys.go#L26-L33](https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd/blob/e03c7f4f885d97fc310b068ebca4d5cfb107a782/x/wasm/types/keys.go#L26-L33)

# CW20

CW20 is a _specification_, that means that a reference contract exists and can be used as-is or customised.

We can add support for CW20 contracts and track informations about balances, if the actual contract has not been modified in a breaking way (e.g. changing database keys constants).

## CW20 contract state

Remember: contract state are prefixed in `application.db` with a `0x03` as described here: [https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd/blob/e03c7f4f885d97fc310b068ebca4d5cfb107a782/x/wasm/types/keys.go#L28](https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd/blob/e03c7f4f885d97fc310b068ebca4d5cfb107a782/x/wasm/types/keys.go#L28)

The types of state a CW20 contract have are described here:

[https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-plus/blob/27454abd58d387c9873711a39d0dc2f07d529b5e/contracts/cw20-base/src/state.rs#L32-L36](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-plus/blob/27454abd58d387c9873711a39d0dc2f07d529b5e/contracts/cw20-base/src/state.rs#L32-L36)

We are interested in

- balance (to hex: `62616c616e6365`)
- token_info (to hex: `746f6b656e5f696e666f`)

### Balances

The full **key** (represented as hex string) of a CW20 balance in `application.db` is:

`03_ade4a5f5803a439835c636395a8d648dee57b2fc90d98dc17fa887159b69638b_0007_62616c616e6365_7761736d313467307339773373797965766b3366347a70327265637470646b376633757371676e35783666`

(`_` added by me to separate fields).

This key can be interpreted like this:

- `03` (1 byte) is `ContractStorePrefix` meaning that it contains state of a certain contract instance
- `ade4a5f5803a439835c636395a8d648dee57b2fc90d98dc17fa887159b69638b` (32 bytes) is the address of the contract instance
- `0007` (2 bytes) is the length of the key “type” that can be read/written by the contract
- `62616c616e6365` is the key “type”. Note that in this case its length is 7 bytes. Also note that this if converted to ASCII this string it’s simply `balance`.
- `7761...3666` is the address of the CW20 token holder this balance refers to.
  Note that this is a hex representation of an ASCII string, in this case it’s `wasm14g0s9w3syyevk3f4zp2rectpdk7f3usqgn5x6f`, the bech32 string of an address of the chain. CW20

The **value** in the database is just a string representing the balance itself, i.e. `100000`.

### Token info

The full **key** (represented as hex string) of a CW20 token info object in `application.db` is:

`03_ade4a5f5803a439835c636395a8d648dee57b2fc90d98dc17fa887159b69638b_746f6b656e5f696e666f`

(`_` added by me to separate fields).

This key can be interpreted like this:

- `03` (1 byte) is `ContractStorePrefix` meaning that it contains state of a certain contract instance
- `ade4a5f5803a439835c636395a8d648dee57b2fc90d98dc17fa887159b69638b` (32 bytes) is the address of the contract instance
- `746f6b656e5f696e666f` in ASCII is `token_info`

The **value** in the database is a JSON string:

```json
{
  "name": "meme",
  "symbol": "umeme",
  "decimals": 18,
  "total_supply": "169420",
  "mint": null
}
```

# Tracelistener processor

I think we can decide whether implement a “wasm processor” (and then handle CW20 contracts inside that process) or directly write a specific “CW20 processor”.

Either way we are gonna need to handle keys that starts with `03` (ContractStorePrefix) and then parse the key to extract the contract address.

We can have an allowlist of contract addresses or just try to parse them all.

# Running a local wasmd chain

To run a local `wasmd` chain, the following script can be used:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

rm -rf ~/.wasmd
wasmd keys add validator --keyring-backend test
wasmd init test --chain-id testing
wasmd add-genesis-account $(wasmd keys show validator --address --keyring-backend test) 1100000000stake,1000000000validatortoken
wasmd gentx validator 1000000000stake --chain-id testing --keyring-backend test
wasmd collect-gentxs
```

Once the chain has been started with `wasmd start`, the following script can be used to deploy the demo `[cw20_base.wasm](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-plus/releases/download/v0.11.1/cw20_base.wasm)` contract with two balances for the `validator` and `user` addresses.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -e

wasmd keys add user --keyring-backend test

wasmd tx wasm store cw20_base.wasm --from validator -b block --chain-id testing --keyring-backend test --gas 1768165 -y

wasmd tx wasm instantiate 1 "{\"name\": \"meme\", \"symbol\": \"umeme\", \"decimals\": 18, \"initial_balances\": [{\"address\": \"$(wasmd keys show validator --keyring-backend test -a)\", \"amount\": \"100000\"}, {\"address\": \"$(wasmd keys show user --keyring-backend test -a)\", \"amount\": \"69420\"}]}" --from validator --keyring-backend test -b block -y --label demo --admin $(wasmd keys show validator --keyring-backend test -a) --chain-id testing
```
